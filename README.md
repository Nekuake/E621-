# E621 Data Grabber

## What does this do?

Just asks for tag information and exports all tags information as JSON.

## Why?

I needed to develop this for an academic research.

## Will it do something more?

There’s plenty of programs, scripts and bots that do more than this, so probably
not.

## How to use:

**Just fill a valid UserAgent in line 10** and you’re ready to go. Note that the
script will take a while to complete because of limits in E621’s API (2 requests per second)

## Why it takes so much to just fill a JSON?

E621’s has a limit of 2 requests per second. There might be ways to work around this limit but I am not risking to get IP's banned.
